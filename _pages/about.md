The Social Tech Collaborative is a group of nonprofit, social impact organizations focused on leveraging technology to transform how public-serving institutions deliver and manage social support and services to better serve the community. We work with state, local, and nonprofit agencies across the country to adopt best practices common in the commercial technology sector that are appropriate for the public sector. These best practices drive processes and IT systems to be more human-centered, user friendly, efficient, and outcome driven. Weâ€™re coming together to demonstrate the power of Social Tech in transforming health and human services delivery.

Social Tech is an emerging field focused on transforming social service delivery by partnering with public-serving institutions to leverage technology and design tools that improve access to basic needs.
