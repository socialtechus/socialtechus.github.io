**Vision**

Everyone has the power to access social services with ease and dignity, and service providers have the tools to equitably serve all clients efficiently and effectively.

**Mission**

We come together to leverage our tech-forward organizationsâ€™ perspectives, approaches, and expertise to address structural inequities and barriers in social service delivery.

**Values**

**We demonstrate the value of collaboration.** The work is stronger than if any one organization were to do it alone.  We choose projects that leverage our collaborative approach and our organizational strengths. 
We create an environment that allows the full participation of all Collaborative partners.  We recognize that people and organizations have different skills to offer, different opinions, and different perspectives. We hold space for dialogue and feedback.

**We believe social service delivery should advance equity and justice.**  We recognize that social service systems currently perpetuate structural racial, economic, and health inequities.  It is our responsibility to work with stakeholders to confront and correct inequities in the system. 

**We believe services should be simple, easy, and accessible.**  We act as servant leaders, placing the people who face the greatest barriers at the center of our work. We start by removing barriers that have the greatest impact on achieving equity. 

**We advance technology that is relevant and part of a larger solution.** Everything we create together is open source and built in partnership. We prioritize building tools that are useful over being perfect.

**We are adaptive.** We respond to the changing environment and meet the challenges of the moment. We change our work based on what we are learning together and through our organizations.
