The Social Tech Collaborative is a new effort by a group of nonprofit, social impact organizations focused on leveraging technology, policy, design, and data expertise to transform how public-serving institutions deliver and manage social support and services. We work with state, local, and nonprofit agencies across the country to adopt best practices common in the commercial technology sector that are appropriate for the public sector. While our joint work is new, we’re all well-established organizations with many decades of trusted service and leadership under our belts. So, who is the Social tech Collaborative?

<a href="https://alluma.org">Alluma</a> is a non-profit social enterprise on a bold mission to eliminate the barriers that keep people from connecting to critical help. We create technology solutions for government agencies, community organizations, and others like us who are committed to ensuring economic, social, and physical well-being for all. Powered by policy and technology experts working on the same team to create solutions, Alluma puts the needs of its clients and the people it serves at the center of its focus, merging the practices of human-centric technology and social policy analysis. Since our first project in 1999, we have tackled our work with tenacity and curiosity. That first challenge—improving enrollment in the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in California—led us to develop Health-e-App, the first Web- based system in the U.S. that fully automated enrollment into a public coverage program. Since then, we have successfully delivered online people-directed health and human service benefit tools to help health systems, public agencies, and community organizations.

</div>

<a href="https://civilla.com">Civilla</a> is a nonprofit design studio dedicated to changing the way our public-serving institutions work. We wake up every day with the goal of positively impacting one billion people through institutions that are more compassionate, more effective, and less expensive to operate. There is no way we’ll be able to do this alone. It will take a community of leaders and change makers to rally around a new way forward. Our work started in Michigan in 2015 when we partnered with state leaders to streamline the longest public benefit application in America. In a few short years, the work has already improved service for over 2.5 million people across the state. Today, we’re building a more human-centered safety net while expanding our efforts beyond health and human services.

<a href="https://codeforamerica.org">Code for America</a> uses the principles and practices of the digital age to improve how government serves the American public, and how the public improves government. Since its launch in 2011, Code for America has worked with government to help the people who need it most using modern design and technology and agile, iterative, user-centered approaches. Code for America believes that government can work for the people, by the people, in the digital age, and that government services can and should be as good as the best consumer services: simple, accessible, and easy to use. And when they are, we all spend less, get better outcomes, and serve everyone with dignity and respect.

<a href="https://mrelief.com">mRelief</a> is a nonprofit startup working to help people gain access to social services and eat with dignity. The average food stamp applicant needs to fill out an application that is more than 20 pages or sit through a 90-minute phone call, and then submit as many as 10 required documents all in order to find out if they even qualify for the program. mRelief works to change the status quo of this process and to ensure that anyone can access the safety net without it contributing to the already stressful circumstance of poverty.
